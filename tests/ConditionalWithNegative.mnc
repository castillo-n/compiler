/:
This is a test of using negative number inside a conditional statement.
Macc n Cheese does not allow for negative literals, so you cannot perform a check like "1 < -1".
However, you can work around this with something like "1 < 0 - 1".
:/

if (1 < 0 - 1)
	shout "Error.";
else
	shout "Success.";
end

if (0 - 1 < 1)
	shout "Success.";
else
	shout "Error.";
end
